This special issue brings out some sensors and their operational application themes such as agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, ground water targeting, water resources, land use, urban sprawl, geology, environment, coastal zone, marine resources, snow and glacier, disaster monitoring and mitigation, infrastructure development etc. in which India has extensively used remote sensing data. <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/40010/87/4/page/1" target="blanck">[https://link.springer.com/journal/40010/87/4/page/1]</a> December, 2017</li>
									<li>Special Issue: <b>Biodiversity and Conservation Jr. (Springer)</b> on Climate Change and Biodiversity. The special issue accommodates 11 papers that document studies on the Indian subcontinent through experiments, measurements, and modeling, with or without geo-information technology, to enhance our understanding of the effects of climate change that may have on biodiversity of the Indian region. The papers included here have been selected from those presented at the 1st International Workshop on Bio-Diversity and Climate Change (BDCC-2010) held in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India, on 19-22 December 2010.

									<li>Special Section: <b>Current Science (India)</b> - Forest Biodiversity, Climate and Geo-Informatics, 2012. This special section accommodated 6 manuscripts selected from those presented at the 1st International Workshop on Bio-Diversity and Climate Change (BDCC-2010) held in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India, on 19-22 December 2010. Climate has a significant influence on the distribution, structure and ecology of forests and their biodiversity content and vice versa; and these studies are increasingly benefitted from modern tools such as remote sensing, GIS, GPS and Species Distribution Model (SDM).
