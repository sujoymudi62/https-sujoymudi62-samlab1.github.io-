			<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), Government of India, New Delhi had chosen Centre for Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere and Land Sciences (CORAL) of Indian Institute Technology Kharagpur as a venue to organize a one-week compulsory training course for Indian Forest Service (IFS) Officers on New Tools and Techniques for Preparation of Working Plan for Integrated Forest and Biodiversity Management and its Implementation. The course was organized from 26th to 30th September, 2011. The objective of the course was to emphasize upon how to implement new tools and techniques of geo-information (viz., remote sensing, GIS and GPS) and modelling in working plan preparation for integrated forest and biodiversity management.
<br><br>
</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Immediately on receipt of list of nominated officers from MoEF, the centre contacted (with information on course schedule, accommodation at IIT Kharagpur, travel direction etc. by FAX, surface mail and e-mail) the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCFs) of the concerned states to provide the contact details and postal addresses of the nominated officers (Annexure-I). The officers were further contacted via phone and E-mail. Out of 40 nominated IFS officers 24 have finally turned up for the training course making it to 60% (Table 1). The participants were informed (to come prepared) to share their experiences through making presentations and interactions. All Officers were provided with double-bed single room AC accommodation on single-occupancy basis in Technology Guest House (TGH) IIT Kharagpur. Participants were provided with to and fro transportation facilities from Kolkata airport/ Kharagpur railway station as per requirement.</li>
				<li>Eminent Scientists/ Academicians and Resource Persons from different institutions were invited as the guest lecturers. They were joined by CORAL faculty members and research colleagues.

						</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Proceeding of the Training Course: On 26th September 2011 at 0930 Hrs., the training course was kicked-off with an inauguration function wherein all the participating IFS Officers were welcomed to the campus with a formal introduction among/ between the officers and resource persons (Photo-I). The training course was conducted as per the program (Table 2) that was prepared with the advice of Sri. VK Sinha, CCF (WP), U.P. state forest Department, Lucknow (Photo-II). Course materials containing all the lecture notes were provided to all the Officers in bounded form along with the Registration Kits (enclosed herewith). Many other relevant materials as discussed during the course and desired by the IFS Officers were provided in digital form in a CD. Relevant additional information/ materials were kept on display/ distribution on daily-basis for the utility of the IFS Officers. Two films were played i.e., (i) Remote Sensing and Space technology w.r.t. Indian Space program and (ii) Seasonal forest and its conservation; that were appreciated by all the participating officers. Field visit was conducted to Eco-Park, Kharagpur Forest division; wherein reconnaissance survey, GPS tracking and Tree height estimation were demonstrated.<br><br>For LAB exercises, Officers were asked for choice among (i) Basics of remote sensing, GIS and GPS tools, (ii) Geo-information and modeling tools for Working Plan development and updating (iii) Biodiversity assessment and modeling using geo-information tools, (iv) Forest Biomass and Carbon assessment and modeling using geo-information tools and (v) Spatial decision support system for forest management; and accordingly 3-laboratory classes were conducted in sub-groups.</li>
				<li>On the day-2, a panel discussion was carried out on the topic Improvement in the Working of Forest Departments- Need for Career Development through Training and Improvement of Skills wherein the problems of the stated topic were discussed and the participants view point were noted as below:
						<ul>
						<li>Recommendations for Improvement in the forest department working through capacity building have been made several times over past, but its implementation has not been apparently done!</li>
						<li>Mid-Career Training (MCT) programs should be retained and strengthened.</li>
						<li>Forest personnel trained in specialized streams generally are not posted to relevant positions, thereby their expertise remains un/under-utilised.</li>
						<li>The state forest departments should develop a system to ensure percolation of knowledge gained during the training programs by individual officers and the knowledge should be implemented. Examples may be derived from Karnataka state where effective utilization is being done in case of E-governance.</li>
						<li>Training on new tools like Geo-information and modelling should be imparted to as many IFS officers as possible for effective forest monitoring, management, conservation; and for its utility as evidence in disputed cases.</li>
						<li>More avenues should be made for specialized training and more number of persons be nominated for specialized training programs.</li>
						<li>Forest Officials may be allowed to join research studies with reputed organisation at any point in their career with a view to the understanding of the complete logic and processes involved in an issue.</li>
						
						</ul>

				</li>
				
				<li>Participation Certificate: All the participating IFS Officers were provided with a participation Certificate attached to a Memento of IIT Kharagpur, an ‘Image Processing’ book (by Lilliesand and Kiefer) and additional INFO in the Valedictory function. Participants feedback and attendance were received and being forwarded (Photo III-VI). </li>
